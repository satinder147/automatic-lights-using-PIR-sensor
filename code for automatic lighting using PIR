/*Hello everybody i am satinder singh
 * this is the code for automatic lighting using a PIR(passive infrared sensor) and arduino uno
 * 
 * It is a very easy project and any one can make this project within few hours.
 * you can watch the video tutorial at 
 * 
 * 
 * components required are
 * arduino uno
 * PIR(passive infrared sensor)
 * Servo motor (instead of a servo you can always use relay because it will be cheap, look better)      (i used servo beacuse i didn't wanted to play with main wires of my room)
 * jumper wires
 * battery (optional, you can use a power adapter rather)
 * motor shield(optional for this project,although i used)
 * 
 *                                                      CONNECTIONS
 *  VCC from PIR -->                        5V on arduino uno
 *  GND(ground) from PIR -->                Gnd on arduino uno
 *  OUT from PIR -->                        digital pin 3 on arduino uno
 *  Servo -->                               digital pin 11 on motor shield or on arduino if you are not using motor shield
 *  if motor shield is not used, then connect vcc from servo to arduino, gnd from servo to gnd on arduino, the third pin to digital pin 3 on arduin uno
 *  warning !!!!!!!
 *  do not connect more than one servo directly to arduino uno as it may draw more current from the board.
 *  
 *  if you are using motor shield then
 *  
 *  Vin from motor shield -->                   vin on arduino uno        
 *  3V or 5v(according to your motor shield)--> 3or 5V to arduino
 *  gnd from shield -->                         gnd on arduino        
 *  Servo -->                                   pin 11 or other to your shield
 *  pin 11 on shield -->                        digital pin 3 on arduin o uno
